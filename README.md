Tic Tac Toe

Game has a test function to greet a user and return user name that works.

Fields for two players to enter their name and greet two players. If no name is entered is asks user to enter names. 

Has an unused function to greet players.  Ended up using two separate greetings. 

I only know how to have to players. How do you get computer to be a player if there's only one player. 

//ONE PROBLEM HERE but this almost works LINE 46//
Have a field for one or two players even though the game only accepts two players. There is a condition for if number is less than 2 or greater than 2 or if a character/letter is entered.  But it won't take '2' as a valid number. what???? 

Has a which player first button that seems to work.  Game tells who will go first. Then assigns Xs and Os.   

//PROBLEM//
Do not know how to assign 'X' to one player then automatically "O' to the other

//PROBLEM//
There are places in HTML for messages, like if a square in occupied or to only enter 'X' or 'O' . Tried to assign JS to check for these or check . 

//PROBLEM--IMPORTANT//
How to be able to enter 'X' or 'O' into a square, have it stay there and then square is occupied. Can't get square cells to take input. 

//PROBLEM//
How to put squares into an array? I have an array and have tried to .push values into array.   Then check arrays for a win or tie and then return a message. 

//RESET THE GAME//
I put a reset game function, similar to the reset button in Guessing game.  Then beginning parts of game stopped working.  So it is commented out.  

//TWO EXTRA RESET FUNCTIONS//
wasn't sure if I needed these. I can delete but was saving in case I needed or one worked better.
